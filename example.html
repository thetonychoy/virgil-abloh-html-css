      <p>Born in Rockford, Illinois (U.S.A.) in 1980, Virgil Abloh is an artist, architect, and fashion designer.</p>
      <p>After earning a degree in Civil Engineering from the <a href="https://www.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>, he obtained a master’s degree in Architecture at the <a href="https://arch.iit.edu/" target="_blank">Illinois Institute of Technology</a>.</p> 
      <p>It was at the Illinois Institute of Technology where Abloh was introduced to a curriculum established by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Mies_van_der_Rohe" target="_blank">Mies van der Rohe</a>, formed from the notions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauhaus" target="_blank">Bauhaus</a>, that taught him to combine the fields of art, craft and design. These theories, merged with contemporary culture, make up Abloh’s inter-disciplinary practice today.</p>
      <blockquote>&ldquo;I love counterfeits, it’s the best feedback. It’s better than a great review in Vogue. If it’s working to a point where someone else can profit […] it’s really working.&rdquo;</blockquote>
      <p>A trained architect, Abloh, who worked in Chicago street fashion, entered the world of international fashion with an internship at <a href="https://www.fendi.com/" target="_blank">Fendi</a> in 2009 alongside rapper <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West" target="_blank">Kanye West</a>. The two then began an artistic collaboration that would launch Abloh's career into founding Off-White.</p> 
      <p><span class="highlight">The first American of African descent to be artistic director at a French luxury fashion house</span>, he was named by <i><a href="https://time.com/" target="_blank">Time</a></i> magazine as one of the <a href="https://time.com/collection/most-influential-people-2018/5238167/virgil-abloh/" target="_blank">100 most influential people in the world</a> in 2018.</p>
      <p>In Abloh's 2018 <i>Time</i> 100 most influential people feature, artist Takashi Murakami wrote:</p>
      <p class="feature">
        <br>
        <span>Kids’ fervor for the stripe patterns and arrow marks he created for his fashion label, Off-White, is not a passing trend;<br>
          rather, it shows how Virgil’s young followers, with their unclouded eyes, have been seeing right into the core of his creativity all along.<br> 
          With his appointment as artistic director for Louis Vuitton’s menswear, his full merit will be understood even more widely around the globe.</span></p>
      <p>Abloh has been the artistic director of <a href="https://eu.louisvuitton.com/eng-e1/stories/men-by-virgil-abloh#" target="_blank">Louis Vuitton</a>'s men's wear collection since March 2018. Abloh is also the chief executive officer of the Milan-based label <a href="https://www.off---white.com/" target="_blank">Off-White</a>, a fashion house he founded in 2013.</p>
